  Hello, I am Raza. I am a **Deep Learning enthusiast** with over **1.5 years** of experience in this particular field. I was born in Pakistan but I am currently residing in a city called Stuttgart in Germany.
  I am a native speaker of Urdu and English (near native). I can also speak German at a basic level but I am persistently learning and improving day by day.

  I have finished a **Master of Science degree in Communications and Multimedia engineering** (with specialization in **Machine Learning**) from one of the prestigious
  universities in Germany called **FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg**. Over the course of my Master studies, I have researched on developing intelligent (yet scalable) learning algorithms for various Computer vision (primarily) problems at hand.

  Speaking a bit about myself, I like **learning new programming languages**, **keeping myself updated with the current advancements in Machine Learning community**, **new technologies** and **writing efficient as well as modular code**. Consequently, I dedicate a portion of my free time
  taking online courses on **Cloud computing services** (<mark>AWS</mark>), **Data structures**, **Databases**, **Big data technologies**(<mark>Spark</mark>) and expanding my insight in the **programming languages** which I already know.

  My **Research Interests** are:
    - Deep learning based Computer vision applications.
    - Supervised Learning.
    - Uncertainty estimation in Deep Learning.
    - Explainable AI.
