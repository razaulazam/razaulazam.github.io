  Hello, I am Raza. I am a **Machine Learning Engineer** with over **1.5 years** of experience. I was born in Pakistan but I am currently residing in a city called Stuttgart in Germany.
  I am a native speaker of Urdu and English (near native). I can also speak German at a basic level but I am persistently learning and improving day by day.

  I am about to finish a **Master of Science degree in Communications and Multimedia engineering** (with specialization in **Machine Learning**) from one of the prestigious
  universities in Germany called **FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg**. Upon the successful completion of my degree, I am looking forward to join a **full-time Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist** role.

  I have been profoundly motivated by the power of **Machine Learning**. Thus, I love developing **efficient** yet **scalable** intelligent algorithms for a variety of application areas. During my **professional** as well as my **academic** career,
  I have essentially worked with <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>C++</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>MATLAB</mark> and <mark>SQL</mark>.

  I am enthusiastic about **learning new programming languages**, **keeping myself updated with the current advancements in Machine Learning community**, **new technologies** and **writing efficient as well as modular code**. Consequently, I dedicate a portion of my free time
  taking online courses on **Cloud computing services** (<mark>AWS</mark>), **Data structures**, **Databases**, **Big data technologies**(<mark>Spark</mark>) and expanding my insight in the **programming languages** which I already know.

  My **Research Interests** are:
    - Applied Machine Learning
    - Explainable AI
    - Improving the performance and robustness of Machine learning algorithms and Neural Networks
    - Uncertainty estimation in Deep Learning
    - Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning
